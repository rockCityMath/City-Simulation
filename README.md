# City Simulation    
A program that simulates a growing city in the terminal. The simulation includes things such as different city zones, growing population, and pollution created by factories. The user can see the daily progression from the city and at the end can see information about the city in its final state.

> Excerpts from the project description can be found in description.txt and show the meaning of the population symbols and how each cell of the city is simulated.
